# Loan Default Analysis

## Overview

This project delves into the analysis of a loan default dataset. Its primary objectives include identifying the key factors influencing loan defaults, exploring customer segments with the highest default risk, and constructing a predictive model to identify high-risk clients.

## Project Structure
- **Source Data Folder**: Contains raw source datasets used in the analysis.
- **Derived Data Folder**: Contains processed datasets generated during data transformation and cleaning.
- **Notebooks**:
  - `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook containing data preprocessing steps and transformations.
  - `EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook with data visualization and initial insights.
  - `Data_processing.ipynb`: Notebook for data processing to prepare data for modeling
  - `Modeling.ipynb`: Notebook for building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Utils Package**: Contains utility functions used in modeling.
- **Results**: Contains presentation of results.
